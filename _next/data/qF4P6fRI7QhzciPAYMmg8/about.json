{"pageProps":{"page":{"title":"About Mike","image":"mike-wallis2.jpg","slug":"about","content":"I am a retired senior banker with experience in mediation, acting as a McKenzie Friend and in business support. I am personable and able to communicate easily at all levels.\n\nHaving worked within the family court judiciary for over twenty years I have gained a valuable insight into how the family court system operates. As such I am particularly highly regarded in family mediation but also with experience in neighbourhood and workplace mediation. \n\nMy experience in the family court has shown me that the court process should be used only as a last resort and that mediation has an important role in helping parties move forward from conflict and breakdown to agreement and brighter futures. However, if mediation is not for you and you decide to go to court then I can act as your McKenzie Friend.\n\nPlease let me know how I can help you by completing the contact form or by sending an email with a brief description of your needs. I will make contact with you within 24 hours. Or just give me a call.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and working with you.\n\nMike Wallis BSc (Hons), FCIB","markdown":"I am a retired senior banker with experience in mediation, acting as a McKenzie Friend and in business support.
